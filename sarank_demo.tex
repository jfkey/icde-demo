%Article search: Given a set of research keywords, Athena returns a list of sorted articles that have a high semantic correlation with the given keywords. Further, it also returns the lists of sorted authors, venues and affiliations in the meantime. For each author ¡ª we combine the importance score of the author and the importance score of all articles of the author under the keywords. The same is true for affiliations and venues.
%
%Author, venue and affiliation searches: Given a (partial) name of an author, venue or affiliation, Athena returns a list of sorted authors, venues or affiliations, respectively, that have a high syntactic correlation with the given (partial) name. Athena returns all authors whose author name contains the (partial) name. And Athena returns the affiliations and venues whose names start with the (partial) name.

\begin{abstract}
Scholarly analysis systems greatly enhance scientific knowledge discovery and propagation.
%
Recently, a number of scholarly analysis systems have been developed. However, these systems either only support ranking limited types of entities or only have basic ranking metrics. Hence, they may face challenges in ranking heterogeneous scholarly entities simultaneously with certain comprehensive ranking metric. In addition, existing systems mainly adopt RDBMS as their storage solutions, whereas the linked feature of scholarly data is largely ignored.
%
To this end, in this paper, we design and develop a novel scholarly analysis system \oursystem. It supports ranking four types of scholarly entities given a query, and is equipped with a total of five ranking metrics, including not only traditional time, relevance and citation-based ones but also a more advanced importance-ensemble ranking metric. Moreover, \oursystem utilizes graph database Neo4j for storage. The linked feature is directly leveraged to facilitate the efficiency of complex query processing.
%Based on the above, we have built an online service for scholarly analysis.
Finally, we demonstrate two use cases in scholarly entity ranking and profiling and the advantage of Neo4j-based storage. %compared with RDBMS.
\end{abstract}

% Up to now, some systems have been developed with a tremendous amount of scholarly data and providing a range of functions to query keywords. However, these systems barely support different types ranking or various entities ranking (\itshape e.g.,\upshape venues, affiliation and authors) when researchers tend to get better knowledge about the keywords. In the paper, we design and develop a novel ranking system for scholarly data analysis that uses graph engine to efficiently manage the heterogeneous, evolving and dynamic natures of structured scholarly data and integrates different types ranking and various entities ranking based on SARank.  bring great convenience in querying scholarly data and discovering knowledge.
